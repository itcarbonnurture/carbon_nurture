 <div class="fw-bold mb-2"> Do you offer a money-back guarantee?</div>
<p>
All sales are final, as results depend on soil, climate, and other growing conditions.
However, we guarantee that our product will arrive in high-quality condition, ready for
installation in your designated field. If you have any concerns, please contact us.</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">Is your product oxo-degradable?</div>
<p>
No, Carbon Nurture mulch film does not contain oxo-fragmentable additives. Our
product nurtures the soil rather than polluting it. Our technology is based on redox
reactions, ensuring complete biodegradation. [Read more here.]</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">How does crop yield with Carbon Nurture mulch compare to PE mulch films?</div>

<p>Field trials in the Knoxville region showed no significant difference in pie pumpkin yields
when comparing PE mulch and BDM treatments (Ghimire et al., 2018).</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">Does Carbon Nurture BDM require tillage at the end of the season?</div>

<p>Yes, we recommend tilling any remaining product at the beginning of the following
season. Exposure to UV and environmental elements will accelerate the biodegradation
process.</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">When does the mulch film start breaking down?</div>

<p>Our films typically begin biodegrading within 4-6 months, depending on the variety
purchased and your climate zone.</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">What are the benefits of Carbon Nurture mulch compared to other biodegradable
or paper mulch films?</div>

<p>Many biodegradable mulch films lack the durability needed to last an entire season and
are prone to tearing during installation due to their limited flexibility. Carbon Nurture
mulch is designed to provide season-long performance with superior strength and
stretchability.</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">Can Carbon Nurture BDM be stored for next season?</div>

<p>Yes! Unlike similar BDM products, ours is shelf-stable. Store it in a dry area away from
sunlight, preferably in its original packaging. If stored properly, it will perform just as well
in future seasons.</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">Will Carbon Nurture BDM leave microplastics in the soil?</div>

<p>No. Once fully biodegraded, our product leaves no microplastics. It breaks down into a
consumable wax that is absorbed by microorganisms, converting into organic carbon
and trace minerals that enhance soil health.</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">Does the film stick to crops as it degrades?</div>

<p>No, our mulch film is specially designed to avoid clinging to crops such as pumpkins,
melons, and squash. This prevents yield loss, unlike other films that may adhere to
plants.</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">What is the best way to irrigate crops when using this film?</div>

<p>Since our film is impermeable for effective weed suppression, we recommend installing
a drip irrigation system underneath it during mulch layer installation.</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">Is this film toxic to plants or soil as it degrades?</div>

<p>No. Our product has passed toxicity tests for soil, water, and earthworms, showing no
negative effects. Instead, it increases organic carbon, enhances microbial activity, and
deposits beneficial trace minerals to help plants thrive.</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">Will this film tear easily or break down faster because it is less than 1 mil thick?</div>

<p>No, our product has been rigorously field-tested and is highly durable compared to other
biodegradable mulch options. We believe it is the best alternative to conventional plastic
mulches available today.</p>

<div class="fw-bold mb-2">Location of Carbon Nurture?</div>
